The program is able two draw 3 fractals, the Mandelbrot fractal and two types of Julia set fractals. The user is able
to traverse the fractal with W,A,S,D and can zoom in and zoom out with Z and X respectively. The reason we chose
this interface over being able to draw a region on the screen is because it is more convenient when the user wants to
move to a different region at the same zoom level. The user is also able to save their images. There are also 3 different
color schemes for drawing the fractal. The user can also change the quality of the fractal image if he or she wishes to
make the fractal more or less complex.

Run main to execute the program.
Install gtkmm-3.0 is needed if you want to recompile the program.
